# Tweet-Sentiment-Monitor
I use the Twitter API, Tweepy, and textblob to analyze tweet sentiment on the Biden-Harris administration. Finally, I use seaborn at the end of the notebook to visualize the results.

Note: change the search term and date interval to analyze sentiment on any other topic and other time periods
